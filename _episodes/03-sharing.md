### Create a repository on GitHub

When we have logged in to GitHub, we can create a new repository by clicking the **+** icon in the upper-right corner of
any page then selecting **New repository**. Let's do this now.

* Create a new repository
* Give it the name `home`

GitHub will ask if you want to add a README.md, license or a `.gitignore` file. Do not do any of that for now.

### Syncing your local repository to the GitHub repository

In the previous episode we created a local repository on our own computer.
Now we have also created a remote repository on GitHub.
But at this point, the two are completely isolated from each other.
We want to link them together to synchronize them and share our project with the world.

To do this, we need the GitHub repository URL, which should look something like this
(with "some-librarian" replaced with your username):

### Cloning a public repo

### Import or Fork a repo


When we begin collaborating on more complex projects, we may have to consider more aspects of git functionality, but this should be a good start. In the next section, we can look more closely at collaborating and using GitHub pages to create a website for our project.
